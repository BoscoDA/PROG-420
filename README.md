# C++ 2
## Local setup (Required Software)
### Docker
To install docker follow this [link](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
) to the install site and choose your operating system. If you are on Windows you have to have virtualization enabled for your CPU because docker spins up a small Linux VM to run docker through since it is a thin abstraction over linux capabilities. Follow the instructions and install. You might also want [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](docker desktop) as a visual way to manage containers. This will allow us to run software with the same environment and settings no matter what platform we are writing code on.

### Visual Studio Code
Visual studio code is the recommended Editor for this class. [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp) it is free, open source and light weight (for some definition of lightweight) and has excellent plugins for c/c++ development (along with basically every other language out there). 

### Visual Studio With CMake
